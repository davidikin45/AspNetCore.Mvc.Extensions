Level 0 = Does not make use of any of URI, HTTP Methods, and HATEOAS capabilities. Typically ignores the HTTP verbs. e.g SOAP using a single URI
Level 1 = Makes use of URIs out of URI, HTTP Methods, and HATEOAS. e.g ASMX Web Services
Level 2 = Makes use of URIs and HTTP out of URI, HTTP Methods, and HATEOAS. e.g REST
Level 3 = Makes use of all three i.e. URIs and HTTP and HATEOAS. This is the most mature level of Richardson’s model which encourages easy discoverability and makes it easy for the responses to be self-explanatory by using HATEOAS.
