Mapping OrderBy

- Can either use EF.Functions in mapping code to ensure all evaluation mapping is done on the sql server. this only works with Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
- Create an IOrderByMapper : IMapper but source and destination types must be the same.

Passing Expression<Func<IQueryable<TDestination>, IOrderedQueryable<TDestination>>> allows passing of strongly typed ordered by AND string ordered by.
when using strongly typed ordering AutoMapper.Extensions.ExpressionMapping converts the properties. doesn't work for Age > CurrentDateTime.Year - x.DateOfBirth.Year

UI Driven (Int,Strings) = OrderBy, PageSize, Page
Code Driven (Strongly Typed) = Where Clause, Includes (fields)
